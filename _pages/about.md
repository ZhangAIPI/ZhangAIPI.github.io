* I am a Ph.D student at [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/). <br>
My advisor is [Prof. Chenliang Xu](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~cxu22/).

* My reseach interests fall on the computer vision, especially the out-of-distribution detection and adversarial learning,  and high performance tensor computation using GPUs. I worked closely with [Dr. Xiao-Yang Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=C83b8ncAAAAJ) and [Prof. Yijie Peng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J9FPMToAAAAJ). 

* I received my B.E. degree from [Huazhong Univerisity of Science and Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn/) in 2022 (majoring in CS).<br>
My undergraduate research advisor is [Prof. Kun He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YTQnGJsAAAAJ).
